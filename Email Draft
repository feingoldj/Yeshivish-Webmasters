Dear Uncle Jason,

A couple of friends and I are trying to build an iOS app. 

The broad idea is to build a platform, geared toward college kids, to coordinate group projects. As things stand, 
the members of a club will use Whatsapp, Google Docs, Where2meet, Doodle, and Trello etc. We would like to have one 
space to chat and share docs, as well as some unique event scheduling / planning features. 

Short term, we're focused on building a feature where an admin can create a group and then automate the process of 
sending and collecting RSVPs. Once a certain baseline number of RSVPs have been collected, the feature should automatically 
sent out a message to confirm the meeting. We think this will be useful for regular meetings that only occur if a certain 
number of people are available to attend. 

We started learning how to code in Swift before running into a bunch of questions about databases and servers. 
Do you have any advice about where to start?

These are the questions that we're trying to answer:

What type of database should we use?
How should we integrate the database into Swift?
What type of server should we use?
What skills do we need other than Swift?
How should we organizing a database to hold groups of users? 

Best,
Jared
