Dear Uncle Jason,

A couple of friends and I are trying to build an iOS app. 

The broad idea is to build a platform, geared toward college kids, to coordinate group projects. 
As things stand, one club will use Whatapp, Google Docs, Where2meet, Doodle, and Trello etc. 
We would like to have one space to chat and share docs, as well as some unique event scheduling / planning features. 

Short term, we're focused on building a feature where an admin can create a group and then automate the process 
of sending and collecting RSVPs. Once a certain baseline number of RSVPs have been collected, the feature should 
automatically declare the meeting. We think this will be useful for regular meetings that only occur if a certain 
number of people are available to attend. 

We started learning how to code in Swift before running into a bunch of questions about databases and servers. 
Do you have any advice about where to start?

Best,
Jared
