# Things we need to figure out:

- should we use Atom, or should we use an IDE? ans: seems like xCode is the way to go in terms of IDE. It's super cool!
           -- think we should use an IDE
- swift or objective-C?
- what program should we use for tutorials? Treehouse?
- which app are we building?


- interaction between front + back ends?
