Goal 1:
This is the functionality we want out of our app. The basic idea is that people will use it to facilitate group meetings 
especially meetings where you want a minimum attendance (minyan?) 

1) user can make an account
2) admin can make a group of other users
3) admin can make events for the group. set threshold attendance/time/place
4) send out alerts to group members
5) collect responses (repeat steps 4-5)
6) declare meeting if threshold met

Whats the difference between users and admins? Shouldn't every user be able to make events? - Ben
Each event itself will only have lmtd num of admins though (similar to whatsapp) - Max

Do we need to have formal accounts (ie. login with username + password)for users/admins, or can we just have
entering your name/email and then responding (like https://www.when2meet.com)? This might make the server
aspect of the project easier but no clue. - Max -- Wouldn't work for reoccuring meetings, would it? - Jared

It actually could work for reoccuring meetings. Realistically, we want to be affecting someones calendar on their phone,
right? So, if you just have the meeting set to be reoccuring, it could contact whatever email account you have set up,
and place that on its calendar. I think that's probably the best way to go about it. However, if we want to be sharing files,
etc. through the app itself, then you want people to have accounts for sure. --DJ
