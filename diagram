Goal 1:
This is the functionality we want out of our app. The basic idea is that people will use it to facilitate group meetings 
especially meetings where you want a minimum attendance (minyan?) 

1) user can make an account
2) admin can make a group of other users
3) admin can make events for the group. set threshold attendance/time/place
4) send out alerts to group members
5) collect responses (repeat steps 4-5)
6) declare meeting if threshold met

Whats the difference between users and admins? Shouldn't every user be able to make events? -Ben
